    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I’m Austin Smith, a cybersecurity engineer focused on cloud identity,
        infrastructure security, and building systems that are resilient by design.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold the CISSP certification and specialize in identity-focused cloud 
        security architecture. My current focus includes Microsoft Entra ID and 
        workload identity design, reinforced through formal study and hands-on 
        experimentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        My work centers around Microsoft Entra ID, Azure security architecture,
        and identity-driven access control. I’m particularly interested in how
        identity acts as the control plane of modern infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of day-to-day engineering, I experiment heavily in my homelab —
        virtualization, local LLM workloads, automation tooling, and secure
        infrastructure design. I treat it as a proving ground for ideas before
        they ever reach production environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe strong engineers build, test, document, and iterate in public.
        This site is a record of that process.
    </p>
